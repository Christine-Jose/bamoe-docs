Table 1. KIE Tools
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Form Generation: Issue in using Array field type
|For Quarkus-based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, the forms can not currently display Array field types by default.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1313[issue,window=_blank].

|Form Generation: Missing support for the form generation inputs
|Currently, the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* in {PRODUCT_SHORT} tools for VS Code only allows as an input the json schemas generated in a kogito app, which means, as a previous step we need a kogito app locally compiled.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1315[issue,window=_blank].

|jBPM Quarkus Dev UI: Wrong behaviors on the Error notification in Start Process Form component
|If we try to start a process instance in the `jbpm-quarkus-devui` and something goes wrong after submitting the form, it shows an error dialog providing some feedback to the user.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1314[issue,window=_blank].

|{Canvas} cannot import files from Github using the raw URL, '/:org/:repo/refs/heads/:tree/:path*'.
|Due to the Github API change, the raw URL does not work. Use the URL, '/:org/:repo/:tree/:path*' to import files from Github, see https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/aCIKe000000XfIg[issue,window=_blank]

Table 2. Standalone editors
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Standalone BPMN and DMN classic editors: The standalone editors examples show some minor issues 
|* Read-only not applied to process variable tags. It can be edited even if a BPMN diagram is set to read-only in the standalone classic BPMN editor.

* Incorrect reference of state-control. Though BPMN is mentioned in the top toolbar with buttons for loading files, it refers to DMN.

* Read-only not applied to boxed expressions as it can be edited even if a DMN diagram is set to read-only in the standalone classic DMN editor.
