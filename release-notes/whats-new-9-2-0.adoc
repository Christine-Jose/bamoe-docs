This section describes the main new functionality and changes in the {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION}

=== Modernized Technology Stack

New support for the Spring Boot framework for DRL across the UI

The following new versions are supported for the technology stack:

* SpringBoot 3
* Quarkus - 3.15
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - 9.5  
* OpenShift Container Platform - 4.16
* Kubernetes - 1.30 
* Google Chrome - Latest release
* PostgreSQL - 16.4
* MS SQL Server 

You can find the supported configurations in the following link: xref:supported-environments.adoc[Supported Environments]

== Management Console
Task management has been integrated from the Task Inbox web application into the Management Console.

New support for authenticated runtimes that use external Identity Providers. The Management Console has a specific configuration that can be set via an environment variable when initializing the Container image: 
-	RUNTIME_TOOLS_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_OIDC_CLIENT_CLIENT_ID.
The environment variable receives the â€œclient_id", which the Management Console will use to communicate with the Identity Providers registered with each runtime.

There is new support for multiple runtimes both with or without security enabled. As a result of this the Management Console is not connected to a runtime when you open it, and you are required to select a runtime to connect to. 

You can connect to many runtimes simultaneously, allowing users to manage multiple runtimes on the same web application.

It is now possible to impersonate another user. This is useful when a User Task is assigned to an unavailable user, blocking the status of that task until the assigned user returns. In BAMOE it is possible to define a group of users that may impersonate any other user, giving them the rights to manage User Tasks assigned to unavailable people.
