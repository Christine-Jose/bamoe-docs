= Upgrading

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]


You can upgrade your existing business automation applications and platforms to the most recent version of {PRODUCT_LONG}. The supported upgrade process is from the previous version to the current version. If you are upgrading from an older version, you must follow the steps to upgrade to each intermediate version, as documented. Depending on the complexity of your installation, you might want IBM(R) Services to participate in your project. If so, contact your IBM service representative.
To know about upgrading to version {VERSION_90X}, see [Link to 90x upgrading topic]

== Prerequisites

The following tools are required to upgrade to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}:

include::../partials/91x-prerequisites.adoc[]

To upgrade from {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90X} to {VERSION}, follow these steps:

* Update Quarkus version to {QUARKUS_VERSION}
* Update pom files from your projects with {VERSION} {PRODUCT_SHORT} BOM
* Rebuild projects and re-deploy as regular software rollout.

For {CANVAS}:

The new containers are the drop-in replacements for the existing. 
You can use https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue/green deployment strategies]

For the new DMN editor:
After upgrade, the New DMN Editor will be opened automatically when you first access it in Canvas or Developer tools for VS Code.
Existing DMN files (any version) can be opened directly in the editor. For more information, see xref:../editing/authoring-decisions.adoc[Authoring decisions]


== Procedure

This section describes the process to upgrade your projects from version {VERSION_90X} to {VERSION}. Before you start, ensure that you have installed or updated all prerequisite tools.

You can upgrade your project in the following two ways by:
* Creating a new project from scratch and moving your existing assets to it.
* Updating an existing BAMOE version {VERSION_90X} project.
You will start by setting up the Maven configuration.

=== Step 1: Download Product Archives

The first step in upgrading is to download the product archives from either {PRODUCT_FIX_CENTRAL_PAGE}[IBM Fix Central] _(which requires an active support subscription to {PRODUCT})_ or via the {DEV_PROGRAM_PAGE}[IBM Business Automation Manager Open Editions Developer Program] _(subject to its terms)_.
Download the files _(replace with the most current version)_ based on your requirement.
The following table shows the most common files but you can select other files according to your environment.


.{PRODUCT_SHORT} Product Archives

The following archives are typically used in upgrading to {PRODUCT_SHORT}:

.Common Product Archives
|===
| Product Archive | Description

| ILMT_for_IBAMOE_**{VERSION**}.zip   
| This archive is used by IBM ILMT to measure the usage deployed in an environment of the product.

| bamoe-installer-**{VERSION**}.jar 
| This archive is an executable file that installs {PRODUCT_SHORT} version  {VERSION_80} in a preinstalled Red Hat JBoss EAP on all supported Linux and Windows environments.

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-add-ons.zip   
| This archive contains things like the Database Migration Scripts (found at path /bamoe-**VERSION**-add-ons/process-migration/upgrade-scripts/**Database**)

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-business-central-eap7-deployable.zip   
| This archive is required if you are running Business Central on your JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-offliner.zip   
| This archive is required to help you to build the Maven mirror repository in an offline fashion, in situations where you need to have a disconnected loading of the Maven repository in your environment.

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-update.zip 
| This archive includes all of the updates that get applied with the overall product set. 

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-kogito-offliner.zip   
| This archive facilitates preparing a Maven mirror repository for offline use.

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-kogito-maven-repository.zip   
| This archive is the Kogito Maven repository, which contains many of the requirements that Java developers typically use to build Kogito-based applications.

| bamoe-**{VERSION**}-openshift-templates.zip
| This archive facilitates building a custom KIE Server extension image for an external database.

|===
[NOTE]
====

In the displayed table, you must replace **VERSION** with the version of {PRODUCT_SHORT} you are upgrading to, such as {VERSION_8_LATEST}.
====

Now that you have the files, you can start the upgrading process.

=== Step 2: Update Maven configuration

{MAVEN_SITE_URL_BASE}[Apache Maven] is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage the build, reporting and documentation of a project from a central piece of information.
{PRODUCT_LONG} depends on Maven to build various types of deployable artifacts, such as decision service applications.
For a quick start, see the {MAVEN_SITE_URL_GETTING_STARTED}[Maven Quick Start Guide].  

Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} is based on Quarkus 3, the easiest route is to use the Quarkus Maven Plugin and adjust some of the details in the generated project to align it with {PRODUCT_SHORT} dependencies and plugins.
You can read all about **Quarkus and Maven** https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling[here].

On the {PRODUCT} version {VERSION_90x} the dependencies were hosted on the https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=bamoe[Maven Central].
Now the dependencies are distributed with a container image or a zip file.
Refer to {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Maven configuration].


=== Step 3: Creating a new project from scratch

Now that you have Maven properly configured, you can create a new Maven project to upgrade your existing business automation assets to the new {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION}.
There are several ways to create Maven projects; this approach uses a published Maven plugin.

[start=1]
. In a terminal window, create a new local folder for the new Maven project, for example, `/Users/developer`, and navigate to that folder.

. Create the project using Quarkus and the following Maven commands. 
This creates a Quarkus project called `my-sample-decision-service`, which is versioned `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, and includes the extensions `resteasy-reactive-jackson, quarkus-smallrye-openapi, quarkus-smallrye-health`.
+
[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:3.8.6:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.ibm.bamoe.samples \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-sample-decision-service \
    -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -DplatformGroupId=io.quarkus.platform \
    -DplatformArtifactId=quarkus-bom \
    -Dextensions=resteasy-reactive-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi,quarkus-smallrye-health
----
+
[NOTE]
====
As you can see from the Maven command, there are a number of possible `extensions` that can be added to the project for the specific functionality. 
You can find more information on available extensions at the following locations:  https://quarkus.io/extensions/[Quarkus Extensions], and https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=kogito[Kogito Extensions].
====
+
When you create this project, you will notice the Maven artifacts being streamed in your console as they are pulled. When the process is complete, you will see a console message like the following:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO]
[INFO] ========================================================================================
[INFO] Your new application has been created in /Users/developer/my-sample-decision-service
[INFO] Navigate into this directory and launch your application with mvn quarkus:dev

[INFO] Finished at: 2024-06-11T11:20:51-03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

[start=3]
.  Add the following `properties` to the `pom.xml` file, using the row numbers as a guide.
This specifies the Maven coordinates for the {PRODUCT_SHORT} Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM), which manages all of the associated dependency versions for a specific {PRODUCT_SHORT} release:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
17   <surefire-plugin.version>{SUREFIRE_MAVEN_PLUGIN}</surefire-plugin.version>
18   <kogito.bom.group-id>com.ibm.bamoe</kogito.bom.group-id>
19   <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
20   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION}</kogito.bom.version>
21 </properties>
----

[start=4]
. Replace lines 31-37, which essentially add the `bamoe-bom` to the list of imported dependencies:
+
[source,xml]
----
31  <dependency>
32    <groupId>${kogito.bom.group-id}</groupId>
33    <artifactId>${kogito.bom.artifact-id}</artifactId>
34    <version>${kogito.bom.version}</version>
35    <type>pom</type>
36    <scope>import</scope>
37  </dependency>
----
+
A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of parts or components that are required to build a product.
BOMs are ordinary `pom.xml` files that contain no source code, and their only purpose is to declare their bundled modules.

.Always use the Maven Bill-of-Materials (BOM)
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use a bill of materials (BOM) to manage project dependencies, as it simplifies dependency management by organizing a group of dependencies under a single version. 

The use of a Maven bill-of-materials (BOM) does not add any dependencies to the project.
Rather, it functions as a reference for managing the versions of your project dependencies (and transient dependencies).
====    

A bill of materials (BOM) can be added to an existing POM file by adding it to the **_dependencyManagement_** section as a dependency with a pom type:

include::../partials/maven-bom-now.adoc[]

When a bill of materials (BOM) is used, it is not necessary to specify the version of the dependency, as that appears from the BOM, so your dependencies will resemble the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
        <artifactId>drools-compiler</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

[NOTE]
====
During the course of your Maven dependency update, if you encounter any dependencies that are not included in the bill of materials (BOM) please report it to IBM to be resolved.
====

See xref:../introduction/release-notes/version-mapping.adoc[version mapping for {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_91X}].

[start=5]
. Add the `IBM ILMT Compliance Library` to the `pom.xml`  _(this is required  to report on subscription entitlement usage within the system)_:
+
[source,xml]
----
40  <dependencies>
41    <dependency>
42      <groupId>com.ibm.bamoe</groupId>
43      <artifactId>bamoe-ilmt-compliance-quarkus-dmoe</artifactId>
44    </dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
You might notice that the newly added Maven dependency includes the `groupId` and `artifactId` portions of the Maven coordinates but does not specify a `version` tag.
This is due to importing the `bamoe-bom` into the project, where the various dependency versions are managed.
====

[start=6]
. Add the dependencies.
+
For this example, you will be creating a project with only DMN files.
So you must add the the Drools Kogito Quarkus dependency.
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} some dependencies had a slight name change, see section, 'Maven libraries mapping guide' in xref:../installation/upgrading.adoc[Upgrading] and update accordingly.
+
[source,xml]
----
45 <dependency>
46   <groupId>org.drools</groupId>
47   <artifactId>drools-quarkus-decisions</artifactId>
48 </dependency>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the project files you may be required to add other dependencies.
====

[start=7]
. Disable Quarkus Dev Services.
+
Currently, the Quarkus Dev Services isn't fully supported, meaning that it should be disabled.
To do so, add the following line in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
+ 
[source]
----
quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=8]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+ 
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:
+
[source,console]

----
+
[NOTE]
====
The choice of extensions determines the imported behavior of the project including adding sample models or testing related code.
====

[start=9]
. Add and update Business Automation assets
+
After the project is generated, you must see a project structure in VS Code, similar to the following diagram:
+
.Example Maven Project in VS Code
image::maven-project.png[Example Maven Project in VS Code]
+
As you can see from the figure, a Maven compliant project is generated, including all of the standard folders typically found in a Maven project.
The most significant folder is the `resources` folder, which is where new or upgraded business automation asset files must be stored.
Examples of supported business automation assets are:
+
- Decision Model & Notation (DMN) Models (.dmn)
- Drools Rule Language (DRL) Files (.drl)
- Business Process Modeling & Notation (BPMN) Models (.bpmn)
- Excel Decision Tables Excel Files (.xlsx)
- Standard Property Files (.properties)
- Test Scenario Files (.scesim)
+
[NOTE]
====
The proper folder for unit test files is `src/test/resources`, as this is a testing resource.
====
+
Now, copy all your assets from the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_901} project to the respective folders on the new project.
As the new project uses Quarkus 3, you must make a few more updates.
One of the biggest changes is that Quarkus 3 uses Jarkarta EE 10. You need to update all `javax` to `jakarta`.
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source,diff]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=10]
. Build the project one more time.
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:

Now you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} project.

=== Upgrading a {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} project

Upgrading a {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} project to version {VERSION} is straightforward.
The project structure hasn't changed, updates only need to be made to the project versions, some dependency names, and files.

[start=1]
. Upgrade the Quarkus version.
+
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} the Quarkus version was 2.16 and for version {VERSION} it is 3.8.6.
To make this upgrade, open the `pom.xml` file and do the following change:
+
[source,xml]
----
 ---   <quarkus-plugin.version>2.16.10.Final</quarkus-plugin.version>
 +++   <quarkus-plugin.version>3.8.6</quarkus-plugin.version>
       <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
       <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus</quarkus.platform.group-id>
 ---   <quarkus.platform.version>2.16.12.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
 +++   <quarkus.platform.version>3.8.6</quarkus.platform.version>
----

[start=2]
. Upgrade the BOM and Kogito versions.
+
Previously, the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_90x} used the BOM version {BOM_VERSION_901} and Kogito version {KOGITO_VERSION_901}.
Now, both versions are {BOM_VERSION_911}.
Update the following lines in your `pom.xml`:
+
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
       <kogito.bom.artifact-id>bamoe-bom</kogito.bom.artifact-id>
 ---   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION_901}</kogito.bom.version>
 ---   <version.org.kie.kogito>{KOGITO_VERSION_901}</version.org.kie.kogito>
 +++   <kogito.bom.version>{BOM_VERSION_911}</kogito.bom.version>
 +++   <version.org.kie.kogito>{KOGITO_VERSION_911}</version.org.kie.kogito>
----

[start=3]
. Update the dependencies GAV.
+
In the {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} some dependencies had a slight name change, see section, 'Maven libraries mapping guide' and update accordingly.
+
One of the renamed dependencies is the `groupdId=org.kie.kogito` and `artifactId=kogito-quarkus`, which was renamed to `groupdId=org.jbpm` and `jbpm-with-drools-quarkus`.
+
[source,xml]
----
       <dependency>
 ---     <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
 ---     <artifactId>kogito-quarkus</artifactId>
 +++     <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
 +++     <artifactId>jbpm-with-drools-quarkus</artifactId>
       </dependency>
----
+
Bear in mind that it is required to make changes to any parent `pom.xml` if applied, but this will not be covered here as it depends on your project setup.
This ends the `pom.xml` changes, next, files that need changes

[start=4]
. Update the `application.properties` file.
+
{PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} does not fully support the Quarkus Dev Services, due to that, it is required to disable this feature and to do that, add the following line to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
+
[source]
----
 +++ quarkus.devservices.enabled=false
----

[start=5]
. Upgrading the code to Quarkus 3.
+
A major Quarkus 3 change, is the usage of Jakarta EE 10, meaning that package imports also need to update from `javax` to `jakarta`.
+
This is simply achieved by replacing any `javax` instance over `jarkarta`, like the following:
+
[source]
----
 --- import javax.inject.Named;
 +++ import jakarta.inject.Named;
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Refer https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.0[Quarkus v3 migration guide] for any other change that is related to Quarkus.
====

[start=6]
. Build the project in the root folder:
+
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----
+
You might get Maven streaming text once again, and at the end of it you must have:
+
[source,console]
----
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  8.023 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-06-11T17:09:00-03:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
+
Now, you can start using your {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION} project.

=== Step 4: Add Business Automation Assets

If your project is upgraded from a previous version of the product, you can add the business automation files from the previous project to the `src/main/resources` folder of the new project by copying the files.
If you need to create a new file, use `File : New File` option from VS Code, making sure to specify the file extension to associate the new file with the appropriate editor.

=== Step 5: Update tooling & runtime

Automated update tools are often provided with both patch updates and new minor versions of {PRODUCT} to facilitate updating certain components such as Decision/Business Central, KIE Server, and the headless controller.
Other {PRODUCT} artifacts such as decision engine and standalone Decision/Business Central, are released as new artifacts with each minor release and you must reinstall them to apply the update.

[NOTE]
====
You can deploy the latest version of {PRODUCT} as either a new installation or as a patch update from one of the previous patch releases.
====

You can use the same automated update tool to apply both patch updates and minor release upgrades.
Patch updates of {PRODUCT} include the latest security updates and bug fixes.
Minor release upgrades will include enhancements, security updates, and bug fixes.

[NOTE]
====
Only updates are included in the {PRODUCT} update tools.
Updates to {EAP} must be applied using {EAP} patch distributions.
For more information about Red Hat JBoss EAP patching, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/patching_and_upgrading_guide/index[{EAP} Patching and Upgrading Guide].
====

=== Step 6: Compile, Build, Test, Deploy

You can follow the standard guidance on how to maintain your decision service project, including how to build using Maven and how to deploy to your target Kubernetes-based environment.
This includes not only creating and publishing the new project to an enterprise GIT repository but also configuring your CI/CD pipeline to pull from GIT and performing a Maven build/test/deploy, etc.

[NOTE]
====
After completing the upgrade of the project, you might want to consider upgrading your technical rules to use new language features, such as `rule units` and `OOPATH syntax`.
Refer to xref:drl.html[Drools Rule Language Migration] for information on upgrading to the latest version of Drools Rule Language (DRL).
====


=== Maven libraries mapping guide

With the transition of the KIE projets to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), it has become necessary to rename a number of Maven modules.  The following table(s) describe the changes to the Maven GAV (GroupID/ArtifactID/Version) that happened in {VERSION_910}:

The general guidelines are:

* xref:../installation/gav-mapping-rules.adoc[Drools Maven mappings] for anything related to rules or decisions.
* xref:../installation/gav-mapping-process.adoc[jBPM Maven mappings] for anything related to BPMN-based stateless/stateful processes.
* xref:../installation/gav-mapping-kogito.adoc[Kogito Maven mappings] for anything related to infrastructure or extended services.
* xref:../installation/gav-mapping-kie.adoc[KIE Maven mappings] for anything else that does not fall into the above categories.
