= Authoring business processes with BPMN 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

This section lists the newly supported Business Process Model And Notation (BPMN) elements in the technology preview and describes how to use them in the Canvas workflow editor. 

// New elements: process variables, events, service tasks a.k.a work item handlers, script and decision tasks, timers, Human-tasks 

== Supported BPMN process elements
As this technology preview provides persistence to support stateful process execution, all BPMN elements that go through an idle state are supported. 

[%header,cols="3"]

^|Element 
^|Type 
^|SDescription 

|Intermediate Message | Event | Causes idle time till a message is provided 
|Intermediate Signal | Event | Causes idle time till a signal is provided
|Intermediate Timer  | Event | Causes idle time till timer times out
|Human Task Node | Activity | Calls human task subsystem and waits till human completes the task
|Human Task Notification | HT Event | Notifications HT
|Human Task Deadline  | HT Event | Deadline notifications
|Boundary Event Message   | Event | Causes branch a path in an ongoing activity execution when a message is reaches it (might cancel or not)
|Boundary Event Signal  | Event | Boundary Event Signal
|Boundary Event Timer  | Event | Causes branch a path in an ongoing activity execution when a timer timesout (might cancel or not)
|Start Event Message  | Event | Causes to start an execution of a workflow when a message reaches the engine
|Start Event Signal  | Event | Causes to start an execution of a workflow when a signal reaches the engine
|Event Gateway  | Event | Causes several waiting at the same time
|AdHoc Tasks  | Activity | Allows triggering tasks when there is no incoming connections
|AdHoc Subprocess  | Event | Allows triggering a subprocess when there is no incoming connection to a subprocess

== Authoring processes in {CANVAS}

Process authoring on {CANVAS} happens inside the Editor page for Workflow, where you can edit and validate BPMN files.

Let's start by describing the elements present in the BPMN Editor.

. *Node palette* → From here you can select node types and their variations.
. *Side panel strip* → Lets you select which side panel you want to toggle.
  From top to bottom, those are the available panels:
[loweralpha]
.. Properties → Lets you manage the properties of a Workflow element.
.. Navigator → Displays a minimap with the diagram of your Workflow and a list of all elements present on it.
. *Keyboard shortcuts panel toggle →* Clicking here toggles a panel with information about keyboard shortcuts available in the BPMN Editor.

Toggling the Problems tab lets you see static validation errors that {CANVAS} reports while you're developing your Workflows.

Developing Workflows through BPMN files is a complex subject and has many intricacies that are beyond the scope of this document.
Please refer to BPMN-specific material, like the https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF[BPMN specification] itself.

=== Invoking a Decision from a Workflow

A common use case for a Workflow is to invoke Decisions as part of its logic.
Luckily, it's very easy to achieve that on {CANVAS}.
On your Workflow, create a new “Business Rule” task node.

.Node palette open for Task nodes inside the BPMN Editor on {CANVAS}

Open the “Properties” panel using the first icon at the “Side panel strip” and look for Implementation/Execution.
There, you can change the "Rule language" to "DMN". Select the file you want and the Decision inside it.
Here's an example:

.Implementation/Execution section of the Properties panel for a Business Rule Task inside a Workflow

When your Workflow executes, this Decision will be invoked with the inputs being passed to the Business Rule task.
The result of the Decision will be the output of the Business Rule task.
