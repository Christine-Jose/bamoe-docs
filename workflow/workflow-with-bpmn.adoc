= Workflow with Business Process Model And Notation 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

This section lists the newly supported Business Process Model And Notation (BPMN) elements in the tech preview showing examples of how to use them in the two possible BPMN editors: Canvas and VS Code. 

New elements: process variables, events, service tasks a.k.a work item handlers, script and decision tasks, timers, Human-tasks 

== BPMN Elements supported in a stateful workflow
As this technology preview provides persistence to support stateful workflow execution, all BPMN elements that go through an idle state are supported.

|Element | Type | Description 
|Intermediate Message | Event | Causes idle time till a message is provided 
|Intermediate Signal | Event | Causes idle time till a signal is provided
|Intermediate Timer  | Event | Causes idle time till timer times out
