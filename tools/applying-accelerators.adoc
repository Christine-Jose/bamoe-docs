= Applying Accelerators 
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

Accelerators are project templates that get applied on top of your existing Decisions and Workflows, allowing you to develop them with more control.
{CANVAS} provides a useful set of Accelerators out of the box -- Decisions with Quarkus and Business Automation with Quarkus (*← Not definitive names*).

There are many ways to create a Business Automation project, and Accelerators are one of them.
When you select one from the “Apply accelerator” dropdown, you'll see a label displayed on your project.

Successfully applying an Accelerator creates a `.kie-sandbox` directory on your workspace root. 
This directory will have an `accelerator.yaml` file which contains all information used during the apply operation. 
The file indicates that an Accelerator was applied to the workspace and therefore should not be removed. 
Clicking on the Accelerator label will open a modal with the `accelerator.yaml` information.

[NOTE]
====
We do not recommend changing the `accelerator.yaml` file content as it will wrongfully guide users.

The set of available Accelerators on {CANVAS} can be customized for your organization.
If you have specific configurations that are common to all new Business Automation projects in your organization, refer to “Installation, {CANVAS}” for more information.
