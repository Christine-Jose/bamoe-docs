= Form Generation Tool

include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

*{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* generates web forms needed for Workflows execution.

Before you start using *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}*, be sure you understand xref:../tools/authoring-workflows.adoc[Workflows,window=_blank], formerly known as Business Processes, properly.

== Tool Installation
Before you begin the installation, be sure your machine meets the following prerequisites:

*Installation prerequisites*

- Node 18 (To install it, follow these https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/[instructions,window=_blank])


Once the prerequisites are met, it is easy to install *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}*.
It is available as the `@kie-tools/form-generation-tool` `npm` https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kie-tools/form-generation-tool[package,window=_blank].
To installl this package, simply issue the `npm` command below or any other command you use for installing `npm` packages:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g @kie-tools/form-generation-tool
----


NOTE: Use version higher than *0.32.0*.


Once the installation is done, you can start using *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* from your command line.
Type command below to double-check successful installation.

[source,bash]
----

== Form Generation

You can generate forms using *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* for any Workflow that requires input data.
However, for this documentation you can use existing https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] community projects stored https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples[here,window=_blank], especially those that have a process in the project name, for example, `process-quarkus-example`.
Or you can use your own project.


Browsing linked examples, you may notice the projects use Maven.
So when Maven builds an https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project, Kie generates JSON schemas to represent the data models for both Workflows and User Tasks.
Then *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* locates those JSON Schemas in the project and taking advantage of the Uniforms APIs, processes them and generates static forms as a resource in the project `src/main/resources/forms` folder.

*Generation Prerequisities*

- Make sure your https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] project has been compiled, otherwise the CLI won't be able to find all the form schemas.

As you installed the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* globally, you can run the command from anywhere.
[source,bash]
----
form-generation-tool
----

This will start a wizard to help you generate the forms:

First, set the path to your https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie,window=_blank] Project.
You can use https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-examples/tree/stable/kogito-quarkus-examples/process-quarkus-example[process-quarkus-example,window=_blank].

[source,bash]
----
Kogito Form Generation CLI
===========================
 
This tool will help you generate forms for the Processes and User Tasks in your Kogito Projects.
The tool will search for the User Tasks JSON schemas generated in your project, so make sure the project is build.
The generated forms will be stored as resources in your project (in src/main/resources/forms folder).
 
? Type your Kogito Project path:---> /path/to/my/projects/process-quarkus-example <---
----

Select one of the available Form types (Patternfly or Bootstrap 4).
You can use Bootstrap 4.
Use arrow keys to change the selection.

[source,bash]
----
? Select the Form type:
  patternfly
❯ bootstrap
----

Confirm Selection, type *Y*, to start the Form Generation process.

[source,bash]
----
Current selection:
Project path: /path/to/my/projects/process-quarkus-example
Form type: bootstrap
 
? Do you want to continue? (Y/n) Y
----

Once the generation is done, browse to `/path/to/my/projects/process-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/forms` folder.

[source,bash]
----
ls /path/to/my/projects/process-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/forms/
 
demo_orderItems.config
demo_orderItems.html
demo_orderItems_Verify_order.config

One question that may come to your mind, is why there are so many forms.
There is only three Workflows in `process-quarkus-example` project. 
User Tasks also have forms generated.
Even though there only three Workflows in the process-quarkus-example project, there are more than three *.html* files due to the User Task generated forms.

=== Form Type
*{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* supports two form types:

* *patternfly*: This type generates *.tsx* files using the *patternfly* library for styling the forms.
* *bootstrap*: This type generates *.html* files using the *bootstrap* library for styling the forms.

Furthermore, according to the file name extension, you can say that *.tsx* files are **React** forms and *.html* files are *plain html* forms.

=== Form Config
Each generated form, both *patternfly* and *bootstrap*, has its corresponding *.config* file.
Such config file contains schema information of the object, that the form is generated for.
Furthermore, the goal of this *.config* file is to load additional scripts and styles.

For the *patternfly* forms, by default no additional scripts or styles are loaded.

For the *bootstrap* forms, by default `bootstrap@4.0.0` styles and `jquery@3.2.1` scripts are loaded.

== Form DevUI
For Quarkus based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, you can use and test them by using the *jBPM Quarkus DevUI* extension.

To do so, just add the following dependency in your project `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jbpm</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbpm-quarkus-devui</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Use version *Apache Kie 10* or higher.

And start the project in Dev mode with the command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean quarkus:dev
----

Then in your browser, navigate to:
[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/extensions
----

[NOTE]
====
Currently there is an https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/836[issue,window=_blank] blocking users from navigating to the *Forms* view.
As a workaround, use a url `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-v1/`.
====

On the displayed page, find this card and click *Forms*.

.jBPM Runtime Tools Quarkus Dev UI Card
image::tools/jbpm-runtime-tools-quarkus-dev-ui.png[jBPM Runtime Tools Quarkus Dev UI Card]


Now you can see a list of all available forms that you listed already via the command line earlier in this documentation.

.Forms list
image::tools/forms.png[Forms list]

Then, if you choose any form, you will have an option to adjust it. 
You will continue with the *persons* form.
Click on it to ipen it.
Now you can two tabs *Source* and *Connections*.


=== Source
The *Source* tab displays the form source code on the left side, while on the right side there is the form UI.

.Persons form
image::tools/persons.png[Persons form]

Let's change this piece of the source code
[source,html]
----
<div class="form-check">
  <input type="checkbox" id="person.adult" name="person.adult" class="form-check-input" />
  <label class="form-check-label" for="person.adult">Adult</label>
</div>
----

to
[source,html]
----
<div class="form-check">
  <input type="checkbox" id="person.adult" name="person.adult" class="form-check-input" />
  <label class="form-check-label" for="person.adult">Is Adult?</label>
</div>
----

and click the *Execute form* button. You can see the result.

.Updated persons form
image::tools/persons-updated.png[Updated persons form]

The same functionality is available for the `React` forms.

=== Connections
The *Connections* tab displays loaded scripts and styles.

IMPORTANT: This tab is for loading external resources only.

You can try to load newer `bootstrap@5.1.3` version.

To do it, you need to update the `persons.config` from:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

to:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "jquery.js": "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js",
    "bootstrap.bundle.min.js": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  },
  "styles": {
    "bootstrap.min.css": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  }
}
----

After updating `persons.config` to use `bootstrap@5.1.3` instead of `bootstrap@4.0.0` the form UI should be more compact, using smaller visual gaps between elements.
