= DMN and BPMN Editors JavaScript Libraries
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

The editors used in both {CANVAS} and {DEV_TOOLS} are also available as standalone Javascript libraries that can be imported into any frontend web application.

They are available from the following two separate libraries that can be installed from npm:

* **@ibm/bamoe-standalone-bpmn-and-dmn-editors-classic**: For the classic DMN and BPMN Editors
* **@ibm/bamoe-standalone-dmn-editor**: The new and modern DMN Editor

== Classic DMN and BPMN Editors

The following classic GWT-based editors are available as JavaScript file for each Editor.

=== Installing and using the classic DMN and BPMN Editors

Installing and using each Editor is the same, as they are built to expose the same generic API to set and get content, export preview SVGs, undo and redo edits, and more. Follow these steps to install the editors:

* Add the following library to the project's `package.json`:
[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
npm install @ibm/bamoe-standalone-bpmn-and-dmn-editors-classic@{NPM_VERSION}
----

* Import each Editor to a JavaScript file with the following statements:
[source,javascript,subs="+attributes"]
----
import * as BpmnEditor from "@ibm/bamoe-standalone-bpmn-and-dmn-editors-classic/dist/bpmn"
import * as DmnEditor from "@ibm/bamoe-standalone-bpmn-and-dmn-editors-classic/dist/dmn"
----

* Add a `div` container for each Editor in the HTML where the library loads an iFrame with all the Editor's resources:

[source,html,subs="+attributes"]
----
<div id="bpmn-editor-container"/>
<div id="dmn-editor-container"/>
----

* Load each Editor by passing the reference to the respective `div` container as follows:

[source,javascript,subs="+attributes"]
----
const bpmnEditor = BpmnEditor.open({
 container: document.getElementById("bpmn-editor-container"), <1>
 initialContent: Promise.resolve(""), <2>
 readOnly: false, <3>
 origin: "*", <4>
 onError: () => {}, <5>
 resources: new Map([]) <6>
});

const dmnEditor = DmnEditor.open({
 container: document.getElementById("dmn-editor-container"), <1>
 initialContent: Promise.resolve(""), <2>
 readOnly: false, <3>
 origin: "*", <4>
 onError: () => {}, <5>
 resources: new Map([]) <6>
});
----

NOTE: The numbers represented against each statement is explained as follows:

<1> `container`: Specifies the HTML element that is appended to which Editor.
<2> `initialContent`: Assigns a Promise to a BPMN XML content for the BPMN Editor or the XML content of a DMN file for the DMN Editor. It can be empty. Following are the examples:
 * `Promise.resolve("")`
 * `Promise.resolve("<BPMN_OR_DMN_CONTENT_DIRECTLY_HERE>")`
 * `fetch("MyBpmnFile.bpmn").then(content => content.text())`
<3> `readOnly`: This parameter is optional and defaults to `true`. You can use `false` for content edition and `true` for read-only mode, where the editor does not allow changes.
<4> `origin`: This parameter is optional and defaults to '*' and the application uses `window.location.origin` as the origin when accessing the application with the 'file://' protocol.
<5> `onError`: This parameter is optional and defaults to `() => {}`): This function will be called if you come across an error while opening the Editor.
<6> `resources`: This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty Map; Map of resources that will be provided for the Editor. For instance, this parameter can be used to provide included models for the DMN Editor or Work Item Definitions for the BPMN Editor. Each entry in the map has the resource name as the key and an object that contains the `content-type` (`text` or `binary`), and the resource `content` (Promise similar to the `initialContent` parameter) as its value. Following are the examples:
 * `resources: new Map([["myWid.wid", { contentType: "text", content: Promise.resolve("<WID_CONTENTS_HERE>")}], [...], [...]])`
 * `resources: new Map([["types.dmn", { contentType: "text", content: Promise.resolve("<DMN_CONTENTS_HERE>")}], [...], [...]])`

|===

The returned objects, (`bpmnEditor` and `dmnEditor`) will contain the methods needed to manipulate the Editor:

* `getContent(): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the Editor's content.
* `setContent(normalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot: string, content: string): Promise<void>`: This method sets the content of the editor. The returning Promise will be rejected if setting the content fails.
* `getPreview(): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the SVG string of the current diagram.
* `subscribeToContentChanges(callback: (isDirty: boolean) => void): (isDirty: boolean) => void`: This method will set up and retuns a callback that needs to be called on every content change in the Editor. The same callback is used for unsubscription.
* `unsubscribeToContentChanges(callback: (isDirty: boolean) => void): void`: This method unsubscribes the passed callback from content changes.
* `markAsSaved(): void`: This method resets the editor state by signaling that the content is saved. It also fires the subscribed callbacks for content changes.
* `undo(): void`: This method will undo the last change in the Editor. It will also fire the subscribed callbacks of content changes.
* `redo(): void`: This method will redo the last undone change in the Editor. It will also fire the subscribed callbacks of content changes.
* `close(): void`: This method closes the Editor.
* `envelopeApi: MessageBusClientApi<KogitoEditorEnvelopeApi>`: This is an Advanced Editor API.
* `canvas`: This is a Canvas API that exposes methods to manipulate the canvas.
 ** `getNodeIds(): Promise<string[]>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the ID attributes of all nodes displayed in the editor canvas.
 ** `getBackgroundColor(uuid: string): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the background color of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `setBackgroundColor(uuid: string, backgroundColor: string): Promise<void>`: This method sets the background color of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `getBorderColor(uuid: string): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the border color of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `setBorderColor(uuid: string, borderColor: string): Promise<void>`: This method sets the border color of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `getLocation(uuid: string): Promise<number[]>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the canvas location of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `getAbsoluteLocation(uuid: string): Promise<number[]>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the window location of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `getDimensions(uuid: string): Promise<number[]>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the dimensions of a node with the provided UUID.
 ** `applyState(uuid: string, state: string): Promise<void>`: This method applies state to a node given the UUID [None, Selected, Highlight, Invalid].
 ** `centerNode(uuid: string): Promise<void>`: This method centers node on the viewable Canvas.

== New DMN Editor

The modern DMN Editor, built with React, is faster and supports up to DMN 1.5 specifications while maintaining the same simple-to-use API.

=== Installing and using the new DMN Editor

Follow these steps to install the new DMN Editor

* Add the library to the project's `package.json`:
[source,shell,subs="+attributes"]
----
npm install @ibm/@ibm/bamoe-standalone-dmn-editor@{NPM_VERSION}
----

* Import the editor library to a JavaScript file with the following statement:
[source,javascript,subs="+attributes"]
----
import * as NewDmnEditor from "@ibm/bamoe-standalone-dmn-editor/dist"
----

* Add a `div` container for each Editor in the HTML where the library loads an iFrame with all the Editor's resources:

[source,html,subs="+attributes"]
----
<div id="new-dmn-editor-container"/>
----

* Load the Editor by passing the reference to the `div` container as follows:

[source,javascript,subs="+attributes"]
----
const newDmnEditor = NewDmnEditor.open({
 container: document.getElementById("new-dmn-editor-container"), <1>
 initialFileNormalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot: "model.dmn" <2>
 initialContent: Promise.resolve(""), <3>
 readOnly: false, <4>
 origin: "*", <5>
 onError: () => {}, <6>
 resources: new Map([]), <7>
});
----
<1> `container`: Specifies the HTML element that is appended to which Editor.
<2> `initialFileNormalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot`: Specifies the POSIX path relative to the workspace root which is `/` by default, including the file name. The path is useful for locating the file in the workspace, especially in relation to other resources (defined by the `resources` parameters). Following are the examples:
 * `model.dmn`
 * `myPath/model.dmn`
 * `parent/child/filename.dmn`
 <3> `initialContent`: Assigns a Promise to the XML content of a DMN file for the DMN Editor. It can be empty. Following are the examples:
 * `Promise.resolve("")`
 * `Promise.resolve("<DMN_CONTENT_DIRECTLY_HERE>")`
 * `fetch("MyDecision.dmn").then(content => content.text())`
 <4> `readOnly`: This parameter is optional and defaults to `true`. You can use `false` for content edition and `true` for read-only mode, where the editor does not allow changes.
 <5> `origin`: This parameter is optional and defaults to '*' and the application uses `window.location.origin` as the origin when accessing the application with the 'file://' protocol.
 <6> `onError`: This parameter is optional and defaults to `() => {}`): This function will be called if you come across an error while opening the Editor.
 <7> `resources`: This parameter is optional and defaults to an empty Map; Map of resources that will be provided for the Editor. For instance, this parameter can be used to provide included models for the DMN Editor. Each entry in the map has the resource POSIX path (similar to the `initialFileNormalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot` parameter) as the key and an object that contains the `content-type` (`text` or `binary`), and the resource `content` (Promise similar to the `initialContent` parameter) as its value. The resources are located in a parent directory (in relation to the current content path, defined by the `initialFileNormalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot`) which will not be listed to be used as an Included Model. Following are the examples:
 * `resources: new Map([["types.dmn", { contentType: "text", content: Promise.resolve("<DMN_CONTENTS_HERE>")}], [...], [...]])`
 * `resources: new Map([["/types/typeA.dmn", { contentType: "text", content: Promise.resolve("<DMN_CONTENTS_HERE>")}], ["/extras/decision.dmn", { contentType: "text", content: Promise.resolve("<DMN_CONTENTS_HERE>")}], [...]])`


NOTE: The `initialFileNormalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot` parameter is only available for the new DMN Editor. The classic editors do not have the concept of relative paths, so every mapped resource is available.

The returned object (`newDmnEditor`) will contain the methods needed to manipulate the Editor:

- `getContent(): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the Editor's content.
- `setContent(normalizedPosixPathRelativeToTheWorkspaceRoot: string, content: string): Promise<void>`: This method sets the content of the editor. The returning Promise will be rejected if setting the content fails.
- `getPreview(): Promise<string>`: This method returns a Promise that contains the SVG string of the current diagram.
- `subscribeToContentChanges(callback: (isDirty: boolean) => void): (isDirty: boolean) => void`: This method will set up and retuns a callback that needs to be called on every content change in the Editor. The same callback is used for unsubscription.
- `unsubscribeToContentChanges(callback: (isDirty: boolean) => void): void`: This method unsubscribes the passed callback from content changes.
- `markAsSaved(): void`: This method resets the editor state by signaling that the content is saved. It also fires the subscribed callbacks for content changes.
- `undo(): void`: This method will undo the last change in the Editor. It will also fire the subscribed callbacks of content changes.
- `redo(): void`: This method will redo the last undone change in the Editor. It will also fire the subscribed callbacks of content changes.
- `close(): void`: This method closes the Editor.
- `envelopeApi: MessageBusClientApi<KogitoEditorEnvelopeApi>`: This is an Advanced Editor API.

NOTE: As of now, the new DMN Editor does not expose the `canvas` property.
