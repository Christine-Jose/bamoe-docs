= Authoring Decisions
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

Decision authoring on {CANVAS} happens inside the Editor page for Decisions, where you can edit, validate, run, and deploy DMN files.

For this version, we have developed a brand new DMN Editor compatible with the DMN specification 1.5. For the purpose of reduce ambiguity on the documentation we will address this editor as the New DMN Editor, and the previous editor as the Legacy Editor. It's important to notice that it is still possible to use the Legacy Editor, but bear in mind that files edited on the New Editor will not be compatible with the Legacy Editor, but the opposite is not true.

Now, we start with an Overview, showing what additional capabilities the New Editor has, then we make an in depth analisys of its features and how to use them.

== New Editor

=== Overview

As mentioned before, the new DMN editor has the capability to open and edit DMNs from version 1.5 or below, but it will always save as a DMN 1.5. This is important as it will not be possible to open the file generated by the New  Editor on other editors that don't support version 1.5, like the Legacy Editor.

The Legacy Editor supported DMN version 1.2 with some additional 1.3 capabilities, making this a huge step in functionalities. Here we summarize those.

=== version 1.3

The Legacy Editor already supported some 1.3 features, such as the temporal FEEL Functions. A new addition is the Group node, an different type of artifact. It enables the user to create groups on the DRD, enhancing the experience by providing a better way to organize and visualize the model.

=== version 1.4

This version adds new functionalities for the FEEL functions, Boxed Expression, and DRD representation.

. FEEL Functions

The following FEEL functions were added: context, context put, context merge, number floor, number ceiling, number round up, number round down, number round half up, number round half down and string join.

[start=2]
. Boxed Expression

Adds the Filter, Conditional, Iterator, Every and Some Boxed Expressions.

[start=3]
. DRD

Adds a marker on the DRD for nodes that has a collection data type.

=== version 1.5

This version adds new FEEL Functions, changes to the DRD and some general changes for the DMN model.

. FEEL Functions

Adds the "list replace" function, and the "scientific notation".

[start=2]
. DRD

Adds the representation of an alternative Input Data node. This visualization adds visual cohesion to the BPMN model. This alternative visual representation is a DRD option, affecting all Input Data nodes on the DRD. More about this on the Editor DRD section.

.Previous missing functionalities
One of the missing functionalities on our legacy editor that was added on the new one is the visual representation for nodes that have missing dependencies on the current DRD.

You can have multiple DRDs and not necessarily import all nodes. This visual representation helps to show the missing requirements in the current DRD.

=== The Editor

Here we show all the functionalities of the New DMN Editor.

.New DMN Editor overview
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-overview.png[]

The diagram and boxed expression editor can be accessed on A. The data types editor can be access on B and to manage the included models we have C.

=== A. Diagram

Opening the diagram for the first time we have a few components to pay attention, and here we enumerate them.

. The editor empty state.

Here you can easily create a starting decision table or a decision with input data node;

[start=2]
. The node Palette:
.. DRG nodes;
.. Artifact nodes;
.. All DRG nodes;
.. External nodes.

[start=3]
. The DRD dropdown.

The place where you can change the current opened DRD, rename it or change its properties.

[start=4]
. The properties panel of the selected element;
. The overlay panel, with customizable style and visualization properties
. The auto layout button, to help you organize your DRD;
. The canvas properties, where you can control the zoom or what you are visualizing.

On the next sections we will explain more about of these functionalities.

==== 1.Empty state

The empty state enables the user to easily bootstrap a new DMN. It has two options:

. New Decision Table

Creates a new Decision node with an empty Decision Table.

[start=2]
. New Decision with Input Data

Creates a new Input Data and Decision node with an Information Requirement relationship.

.Input Data and Decision nodes
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-empty-state-input-decision.png[width=300px]

==== 2.Palette

The node palette enables the user to interact with the DRG by creating new nodes, using nodes from other DRDs and nodes from external models. Also, give the option to create artifact nodes, improving documentation, organization and visualization.

.a. DRG nodes

To create a new DRG node, the user needs to drag the desired node from the palette and drop it into the diagram.

.Dragging a new Input Data node from the Palette
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-diagram-drag-from-palette.gif[width=300px]

Here we use a Decision node to explore all node features.

.Decision node components
image::tools/authoringDecisions/new-editor-decision-node.png[width=300px]

. Node name

The node name has a uniqueness validation. The editor doesn’t allow you to rename a node to a name that is already being used by another node. Empty names are also invalid. Trying to rename a node to an invalid one will cause it to rollback to its previous name. The only moment you can have nodes with the same name is when you create two or more nodes of the same type without renaming it. The following example illustrate two Decision nodes that were created without renaming, and an Input Data node where we try to rename it to “New Decision”, and after it to an empty name.

[start=2]
. Node type

Nodes that have a data type, shows this information on top of the node. It’s possible to change the node data type using the dropdown menu, or even access a custom data type to have a better visualization of the type. More about the Data Types are covered on the B section.

[start=3]
. New relationship

It’s possible to create a new requirement or association relationship from the target node to another  node respecting the DMN specification. The available options varies from node to node.
 
[start=4]
. New connected node

It’s possible to create a new connected node from the target node. It will create a node with the respective relationship. The available options varies based on the node type and respects the DMN specification.

[start=5]
. Edit

This button is only available for the Decision and BKM nodes. Clicking on it, opens the Boxed Expression editor with the node expression. The Boxed Expression editor have access to the DRG context, and are powered by an Auto completion tool, enhancing the user experience when building their Boxed expressions.

[start=6]
. Properties panel

Clicking on this button, will open the Properties Panel of the node. On this panel it’s possible to check and edit the node name, type, description, allowed answer, documentation links, font styles, and shape styles. Also it’s possible to check the node ID. More about this can be read on the "Properties Panel” section.

[start=7]
. Resize handler

Clicking on the small arrow and dragging around it’s possible to resize the target node. Each node has a minimal width and height, trying to resize to a smaller size will not affect the node.

.Decision Service

. TODO

.b. Artifact nodes

The artifact nodes give the user the tools to improve the documentation and visualization of the DRG by modifying the DRD. The Group node creates a visual separation, and the Text Annotation enables to write a small documentation.

.c. All DRG nodes

Clicking on it will open a modal where we have access to the list of all DRG nodes that are part of the current file. It’s possible to filter the nodes by name, and nodes that are part of the current DRD are grayish. Clicking and dragging the node name to the diagram will add the node to the current DRD. More about this can be found at the DRD section.

.d. External nodes

All nodes that are part of the included models can be found here. Clicking on it will open a modal showing all nodes separated by namespace, where you can filter the nodes by name. 

Additionally, it’s possible to see the chosen name for the included model and the DMN file name from where it comes from. On the above example the name is “ex” and the filename “Another DMN.dmn”.

The DMN Editor lets you develop Decisions and Business Knowledge Models (BKMs) using the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.
Drag a new Decision or BKM node to the DRG and let's open it with the DMN Boxed Expression Editor.

_Decision and Business Knowledge Model on the DMN Editor, side by side, showing their Edit button, that brings you to their implementations inside the Boxed Expression Editor, on {CANVAS}._

Selecting Edit on a new Decision will bring you to an empty Boxed Expression.
On a new BKM you'll have an empty Boxed Function.
The implementation of this Boxed Function can be of any type.

Selecting a Boxed Expression type will update the implementation of the Decision or BKM.

Here's an example Decision Table.

And a BKM with a Literal implementation.

The Boxed Expression Editor is very capable, and can handle complex implementations.
It's built based on the same Table component {CANVAS} uses on DMN Runner, so you'll feel at home in both places.

Developing Decisions through DMN files is a complex subject and has many intricacies that are out of the scope of this document.
Please refer to DMN-specific material, like the https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF[DMN specification] itself.
