= Connecting to accounts
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

As mentioned previously, {CANVAS} doesn't feature its own authentication mechanism.
Instead, {CANVAS} allows you to link your existing accounts from your Git and Cloud providers.
These accounts are used when performing Git operations like Pull and Push, and when creating Dev deployments, respectively.

All your connected accounts are visible in the Accounts modal.
It is accessible through the little person icon in the top-right corner.
There you can see how many repositories and deployments are using those accounts.
It is also possible to visualize information about those accounts, such as the date they were linked to {CANVAS}.

You can remove accounts from {CANVAS} using the Accounts modal.
By doing so, repositories linked to Git provider accounts will lose the ability to Push and Pull.
You can change the account linked to a repository at any time, using the dropdown available on the Editor page of any file in your repository.

It shows two connected accounts, one from an OpenShift instance and another from GitHub, respectively.
