= IBM BAMOE Developer Tools for VS Code
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides a handy VS Code Extension that bundles graphical Editors for BPMN, DMN files, and SCESIM files.
The {DEV_TOOLS} extension can be downloaded from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.bamoe-developer-tools[VS Code Marketplace].

The bundled BPMN, DMN and Test Scenario Editors are made available through the KIE DMN Editor and KIE BPMN Editor extensions, and they feature all available features you have on {CANVAS}.
Static file validation, DMN Runner, and Dev deployments are not available for {DEV_TOOLS} yet, but you can achieve a similar experience of DMN Runner with our Test Scenario Editor.
See how below.

== Running unit tests with Test Scenario

=== Setup and creation of Test Scenarios

Please refer to xref:../editing/authoring-scesim.html[Authoring Test Scenario] for setup and scenario creation.

=== Executing the Test Scenario
1. **Save the File**:
   Save the `.scesim` file (`CTRL+S`).
2. **Run Tests**:
   Open a terminal in your project's root directory (eg. the `incubator-kie-kogito-examples/kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-pmml-quarkus-example`) and execute:
+
[source,console]
----
   $ mvn clean test
----
+

Alternatively, if you installed the `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat` extension, run the test from `KogitoScenarioJunitActivator.java` using the `Run Java` button in VSCode.
3. **Verify Results**:
   Check the results to ensure the scenarios pass. The test results will be visible in your Terminal after the completion of the `mvn clean test` command.

Using the `Run Java` button provided by `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat`, the test results will appear in the native VSCode `Test Results` window.
