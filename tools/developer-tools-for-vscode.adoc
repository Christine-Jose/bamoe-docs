= BAMOE Developer Tools for VS Code
include::../partials/attributes.adoc[]

{PRODUCT_SHORT} provides a useful VS Code Extension that bundles graphical Editors for BPMN, DMN, and SCESIM files.
The {DEV_TOOLS} extension can be downloaded from the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.bamoe-developer-tools[VS Code Marketplace].

Static file validation, DMN Runner, and Dev Deployments are not available for {DEV_TOOLS}, however it is possible to get a similar experience of DMN Runner with the Test Scenario Editor.
For more information see below.

== DMN Editor
In {DEV_TOOLS} you can consume DMN files in the following ways:

* **New DMN Editor**:

+
Since {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_911} a new DMN Editor is available. That is implemented with a modern technologies stack and with native support of DMN 1.5 specifications. This new editor can open 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 DMN file versions, and it automatically saves them to DMN 1.5. If you are upgrading from a previous {PRODUCT_SHORT} version (e.g. {VERSION_90X} or {VERSION_80X}), your DMN files will be automatically converted to DMN 1.5 version without any loss of logic.

* **DMN Editor (classic)**:
+

+
This is the classic version of the DMN Editor inherited from {PRODUCT_SHORT} {VERSION_80X}. This editor can open 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 DMN file versions only, and it saves them to version 1.2.
+
NOTE: The DMN Editor (classic) should be considered a deprecated tool. That means, no new feature will land in this editor version and it will be eventually removed in a future {PRODUCT_SHORT} version.

The new Editor is currently set as the default choice for DMN assets. The steps to switch to the DMN Editor (classic) are:

. Right-click on the currently opened DMN file tab
. Select `Reopen Editor with...`
. Select `BAMOE DMN Editor (classic)`
. In the same menu, it's possible selecting `Configure default editor for '*.dmn'...` to change the default editor in your local machine
