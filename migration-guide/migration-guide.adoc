== Maven Artifacts

Starting with version 9.0, all {PRODUCT} artifacts are available directly from Maven Central.
There is no need to include an additional repository in `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`.

Coming from {PRODUCT} v8 or Red Hat Process Automation Manager (RHPAM), you might be familiar with product dependencies hosted by Red Hat in its maven repository; as mentioned above, this is no longer needed.
