== Maven Artifacts

No additional configuration change is necessary in a project migrating from a previous version of {PRODUCT} besides changing the version number.

Coming from {PRODUCT} or Red Hat Process Automation Manager (RHPAM), you will be familiar with the dependencies hosted by the Red Hat maven repository.
An additional repository would need to have been added to the `pom.xml` file or the `settings.xml` for dependencies to be properly resolved.
Starting with version 9.0, all of the {PRODUCT} artifacts are hosted from Maven Central.
There is no need to include an additional repository in `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`
