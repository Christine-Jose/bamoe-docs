You can maintain an up-to-date inventory of software assets that are installed in your infrastructure, gather information about your hardware, and ensure license compliance of your enterprise by using IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT). 
You get to know the softwares that are existing in your system, and where or how it is used. 
By monitoring the consumption of PVU, VPC, and RVU MAPC metrics in IBMÂ® products with full and subcapacity licensing terms, you can understand the current license consumption.
