Before you use {PRODUCT_LONG}, see the known limitations. When possible, workarounds will be included with the limitations.

* KIE Tools
* Technology preview stateful process
* {PRODUCT_SHORT} Maven repository image
* Standalone editors

Table 1. KIE Tools
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Form Generation: Issue in using Array field type
|For Quarkus-based https://incubator.apache.org/projects/kie.html[Apache Kie, window=_blank] projects, the forms can not currently display Array field types by default.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1313[issue,window=_blank].

|Form Generation: Missing support for the form generation inputs
|Currently, the *{FORM_GENERATION_TOOL}* only allows as an input the json schemas generated in a kogito app, which means, as a previous step we need a kogito app locally compiled.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1315[issue,window=_blank].

|jBPM Quarkus Dev UI: Wrong behaviors on the Error notification in Start Process Form component
|If we try to start a process instance in the `jbpm-quarkus-devui` and something goes wrong after submitting the form, it shows an error dialog providing some feedback to the user.
For more information, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-issues/issues/1314[issue,window=_blank].

|BAMOE canvas cannot import files from Github using the raw URL, '/:org/:repo/refs/heads/:tree/:path*'.
|Due to the Github API change, the raw URL does not work. Use the URL, '/:org/:repo/:tree/:path*' to import files from Github, see https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/aCIKe000000XfIg[issue,window=_blank]

Table 2. Technology preview stateful process
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Authentication not supported
|The management console does not support authentication for basic task inbox management capabilities when it is used with the technology preview for stateful processes.
|===


Table 3. {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_910} Maven repository image
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Container runs on port 80
|The container is configured to run the httpd service on port 80. This is an issue when deploying it to restrictive Kubernetes clusters (such as OpenShift) which restrict the usage of ports < 1024 except when made by a Service Account with elevated privileges (for example, anyuid permission on OpenShift). To workaround this, build your own container image.
|===


Table 4. {PRODUCT_SHORT} version {VERSION_911} Standalone editors
[%header,cols=2]
[%autowidth]
|===

|Limitation | Description

|Standalone BPMN and DMN classic editors: The standalone editors examples show some minor issues 
|* Read-only not applied to process variable tags. It can be edited even if a BPMN diagram is set to read-only in the standalone classic BPMN editor.

* Incorrect reference of state-control. Though BPMN is mentioned in the top toolbar with buttons for loading files, it refers to DMN.

* Read-only not applied to boxed expressions as it can be edited even if a DMN diagram is set to read-only in the standalone classic DMN editor.
