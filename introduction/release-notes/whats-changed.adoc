== Overview

With the transition of the KIE projets to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), it has become necessary to rename a number of Maven modules.  The following table(s) describe the changes to the Maven GAV (GroupID/ArtifactID/Version) in {VERSION_910}:

The general guidelines are:

* xref:../../partials/gav-mapping-rules.adoc[Drools] for anything related to rules or decisions.
* xref:../../partials/gav-mapping-process.adoc[jBPM] for anything related to BPMN-based stateless/stateful processes.
* xref:../../partials/gav-mapping-kogito.adoc[Kogito] for anything related to infrastructure or extended services.
* xref:../../partials/gav-mapping-kie.adoc[KIE] for anything else that doesn't fall into the above categories.
