=== Technology preview stateful process services 

A technology preview of stateful workflow services introduced in this release is supported by the new compact architecture. This architecture minimizes the inter-component communication and ensures stability and robustness of BAMOE applications in a Stateful Business Process environment. While BPMN models were supported in previous versions, you can now develop process services using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models in a stateful mode. You can design your BPMN processes with Canvas or the Kogito BPMN modeler in VSCode. xref:../../workflow/workflow-techpreview.adoc[Learn more...]

=== New DMN Editor

A new DMN Editor that is supported by this release provides runtime and design support for DMN 1.5 models at conformance level 3. You can design your DMN models with BAMOE Canvas or import existing DMN models into your {PRODUCT_SHORT} projects for deployment and execution. Any DMN models that you import and open in the DMN editor are converted to DMN 1.2 or 1.5 models. xref:../../reference-guide/dmn.adoc[Learn more...]

You can now access a new DMN Editor that is compatible with DMN 1.5. The 9.0.x DMN Editor, referred as the Classic DMN Editor, is still available and will be referenced throughout the user documentation. By default, the New DMN Editor will be opened when you click it. To switch to the Classic DMN Editor, click the "New DMN Editor" dropdown and select "Switch back to the Classic DMN Editor". The existing DMN files can be opened directly in the new DMN Editor; however, once edited and saved in the new editor, they are no longer compatible with the Classic DMN Editor.
