{PRODUCT} is a cloud-native business automation technology for building cloud-ready business applications. It is built from various Open Source projects including Drools, jBPM, and Kogito. The name _Kogito_ is derived from the Latin "Cogito", as in "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), and is pronounced `[ˈkoː.d͡ʒi.to]` (_KO-jee-to_). The letter _K_ refers to Kubernetes, the base for {OPENSHIFT} as the target cloud platform for {PRODUCT_SHORT}, and to the Knowledge Is Everything (KIE) open source business automation project from which {PRODUCT_SHORT} originates.

{PRODUCT} is optimized for a hybrid cloud environment and adapts to your domain and tooling needs. The core objective of {PRODUCT} is to help you mold a set of business processes and decisions into your own domain-specific cloud-native set of services.

When you use {PRODUCT_SHORT}, you are building a cloud-native application as a set of independent domain-specific services to achieve some business value. The processes and decisions that you use to describe the target behavior are executed as part of the services that you create. The resulting services are highly distributed and scalable with no centralized orchestration service, and the runtime that your service uses is optimized for what your service needs.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} includes components that are based on well-known business automation KIE projects, specifically https://drools.org[Drools], https://jbpm.org[jBPM], and https://kogito.kie.org[Kogito], to offer dependable open source solutions for business rules, business processes, and constraint solving.

=== Cloud-first priority

{PRODUCT} is designed to run and scale on a cloud infrastructure. You can use {PRODUCT} with the latest cloud-based technologies, such as Quarkus, and Apache Kafka, to increase start times and instant scaling on container application platforms, such as {OPENSHIFT}.

.Technologies used with {PRODUCT}

For example, {PRODUCT} is compatible with the following technologies:

* *{OPENSHIFT}*, based on Kubernetes, is the target platform for building and managing containerized applications.
* *Quarkus* is a native Java stack for Kubernetes that you can use to build applications with {PRODUCT} services.
* *GraalVM* with Quarkus enables you to use native compilation with {PRODUCT}, resulting in fast start-up times and a minimal footprint. For example, a native {PRODUCT_SHORT} service starts in about 0.003 ms, about 100 times faster than a non-native start-up. Fast start-up is a necessity in a cloud ecosystem, especially if you need small serverless applications.
* *Prometheus* and *Grafana* are compatible with {PRODUCT_SHORT} services for monitoring and analytics with optional extensions.
* *Kafka* is a middleware technology that {PRODUCT_SHORT} supports for messaging and security.

=== Domain-specific flexibility

{PRODUCT} adapts to your business domain instead of forcing you to modify your domain to work with {PRODUCT_SHORT}. You can expose your {PRODUCT_SHORT} services with domain-specific APIs, based on the processes and decisions that you have defined. Domain-specific APIs for {PRODUCT_SHORT} services do not require third-party or internal APIs.

For example, a process for onboarding employees could generate remote REST API endpoints that you can use to onboard new employees or get information on their status, through domain-specific JSON data.

You can also expose domain-specific data through events so that the data can be consumed and queried by other services.

=== Developer-centered experience

Another focus of {PRODUCT} is optimal developer experience. You can use much or all of your existing tooling and workflow to develop, build, and deploy {PRODUCT_SHORT} services, whether locally for testing or in the cloud. Quarkus offers development-mode features to help with local testing, such as live reloading of your processes and decisions in your running applications for advanced debugging.

{PRODUCT_SHORT} tooling is embeddable so that you can continue using the workflow you already use for cloud-native services. For example, the {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*] enables you to edit your Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)business processes and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) decision models directly in your VSCode IDE, next to your other application code.
