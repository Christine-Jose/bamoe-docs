//tag::maven-setup[]
== Requirements
Set up your Maven environment, following these instructions for doing so xref:../installation/gav-mapping-rules.adoc[Configuring Maven with BAMOE binaries].

== Project Setup Options
With the migration of the BAMOE product to Quarkus 3 the instructions on how to generate a new Maven project have changed. You now have these options:

* Create a project manually
* xref:../installation/configure-maven.adoc[Use BAMOE Canvas] to create a new project using the {CANVAS} accelerator functionality.


== Creating a BAMOE Project Manually
Typically, Maven projects are created either using plugins or archetypes.  You can use a simple Maven archetype to generate a basic Maven project, for example:

[source,console,subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-simple -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false
----

then update the `pom.xml` for the project with content from one of the following templates:

xref:../partials/rules-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Rules/Decision Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical rules/decisions project dependencies and plugins.

xref:../partials/process-sample-pom.adoc[Sample Process Application POM Template] a sample POM that describes a typical process project dependencies and plugins.

Build the project in the root folder:
[source,console]
----
mvn clean package
----

== Editing within VS Code

. Open the project in VS Code.
  From here we can see the workspace contents, and if we expand the contents of `/src/main` you can see the creation of several artifacts. 
  Within `java` you have a `GreetingResource.java` and within `resources` you have an `application.properties` and `pricing.dmn` file. 
  These are sample files that can be later modified or deleted.

. Install {VS_CODE_BUNDLE_LINK}[*{VS_CODE_BUNDLE}*].
  This gives you access to the visual editors for DMN and BPMN files.
  It also allows you to create and edit testing scenarios for projects.
+

. Click the `pricing.dmn` file to open it. 
  When you do so, you may be greeted with a message similar to `The current DMN does not have any Diagram associated with it. Do you want to auto-generate it?` 
  If so click `Auto-generate Diagram` to automap the DMN locations.

. When the diagram opens you will see something similar to below, and you can start exploring it. 
  The DMN consists of two inputs: *Age* and *Previous incidents?*, which are used to make the decision, *Base price*.

. If you click the *Age* input data node and then click the *Properties* icon on the right, you will open a pane for the input.
+
image::properties-open.png[DMN Properties]

. Within this pane, you can see information about the input *Age*, namely that it is a number and its input name. 
  Other changes can be made to the object, including the color of the node, font size, etc.
+

. To view the Decision, click the square decision node and select the `Edit` button to enter the decision for *Base Price*.
+
image::open-decision.png[Edit DMN Decision]

. From here you will see the Decision Table that is associated with the Base Price decision. 
  From here you will see two (*2*) input columns (`Age` and `Previous Incidents`), as well as one output column (`Base price`) all with their types below them. 
  These types are controlled from the properties panel similarly to how they were opened when we previously looked at `Age`. 
  This decision has 4 different rows that could fire, with a Hit Policy of `UNIQUE` signified by the **U** in the top left corner of the table. 
  A decision writer could make any comments they want to the table and have them saved with the decision here.

== Source Control
This is a Java based project, and any tools regularly used for storing Java based source code in a source repository are applicable here.
