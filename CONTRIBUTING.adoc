The documentation found in this repository is written in Asciidoc.
While many tools will work with Asciidoc, as it is purely text, the recommended setup can be done using only VS Code and a small set of extensions.
Below, you will find the recommended setup, as well as some conventions that are being used in this repository.

== Tool Setup

Visual Studio Code (available at https://code.visualstudio.com), known colloquially as VS Code, is a simple code editor.
On its own, it will work fine, however, you can improve your experience by adding the Asciidoc extension.
Adding this extension will provide you with syntax highlighting, live preview, and snippets.

This extension can be installed by visiting https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode, by using the "Quick Open" and pasting `ext install asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode`, or by using the built-in extension browser within VS Code.

There are other extensions which can provide additional insight or aid in the contribution process, but they are not required.
These extensions are "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and "GitLens."
Of those two, "GitHub Pull Requests" is more helpful than "GitLens."

== Git Workflow

The BAMOE Documentation in this repository utilizes feature or topic branches for work.
You can read more about those at https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow[Git feature branch workflow] by Atlassian and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows[Branching Workflows] on the main git website.

Essentially, this means all work should be done on its own feature branch.
The quick and dirty way of doing this is to simply create a new git branch from the `main` (or other version branch i.e. 9.x, 10.x, etc.).
On the command line, this can be accomplished by running `git checkout <base branch name>` followed by `git checkout -b <name of new branch>`.
Other tools have different ways of create a branch.
Later in this guide, the way of doing this using VS Code will be explained and demonstrated.

=== Forking

The main repository, `ibm/bamoe-docs` on GitHub, must first be forked to your own GitHub account so Pull Requests (pr) can be made from your fork of the original repository.
The method of doing so can be found on the https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo[GitHub Docs website].

=== Cloning Locally

Once you have your own fork of a repository, you will need to clone that repository locally to your own machine.

.Cloning a repository locally via CLI
[source,bash]
----
git clone <git repository URL>
----

Using VS Code, selecting the Source Control section on the left will present two buttons "Open Folder" and "Clone Repository".

Clicking the "Clone Repository" button will provide a dropdown where you can specify the location of the remote repository.

It is highly recommended to add the upstream, the original repository, to your list of git remotes and periodically merging (or pull) changes from that repository into your local copy.
The process of performing a merge is detailed later in this documentation.

==== Adding a remote

The standard convention for git is to call the first repository cloned `origin`.
The `origin` in this guide will be your own fork.
This name can be changed, however, it is out of the scope for this contributing guide.
The second repository that should be added to your local repository is called `upstream`.
This should be the `ibm/bamoe-docs` repository.

.Adding a remote via CLI
[source,bash]
----
git remote add upstream <repository url>
----

Adding a remote in VS Code is done by:

. Clicking the ellipsis menu on the ending right side of the cloned repository.
. Navigating to the "Remote" section.
. Clicking on the "Add Remote..." menu entry

You will then be presented with a similar dropdown to supply a repository name and URL as when you originally cloned.

When working within VS Code, it is recommended to have VS Code periodically sync or fetch the upstream repository so your local copy is kept up to date.
